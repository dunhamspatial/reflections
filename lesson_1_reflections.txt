What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Pros: you pick the logical seperation of commits

	Cons: you could lose data if something happens between commmits

	Because most development projects are composed of multiple sub-files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	list the log with git log
	and then use git diff to compare versions	

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
